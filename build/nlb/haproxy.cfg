# This configuration is meant to be installed in front of an existing web
# server that needs some DoS protection. We assume that the web server has been
# moved to port 8080 on the loopback, and that haproxy 1.3.18 is running on
# port 80. Note that Apache will have to be configured to get the client's IP
# address from the X-Forwarded-For header (mod_rpaf can do that).

# This configuration prevents "slowloris" and "nkiller2" from degrading the
# service. See below for more options.
